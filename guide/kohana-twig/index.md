Introduction
============

This is the documentation for Twig, the flexible, fast, and secure template
engine for PHP.

If you have any exposure to other text-based template languages, such as
Smarty, Django, or Jinja, you should feel right at home with Twig. It's both
designer and developer friendly by sticking to PHP's principles and adding
functionality useful for templating environments.

The key-features are...

* *Fast*: Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code. The
  overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.

* *Secure*: Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code. This
  allows Twig to be used as a template language for applications where users
  may modify the template design.

* *Flexible*: Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser. This allows the
  developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and create its own DSL.

Prerequisites
-------------

Twig needs at least **PHP 5.2.4** to run.
